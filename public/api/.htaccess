# Without this, some hosts serve .php as plain text and the app gets "<?php ... is not valid JSON".

# If the above doesn't work, the host may use a different handler; try uncommenting one:
# SetHandler application/x-httpd-php74
# SetHandler application/x-httpd-php80
# AddType application/x-httpd-php .php
